    <h3> 1. What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS? </h3>
    <p> Inline CSS: Requires the style attribute placed inside an HTML element.
        Internal CSS: Requires the style element placed inside the head section of an HTML file.
        External CSS: Requires the link element placed inside the head section of an HTML file.
    </p>
    <h3> 2. What is the syntax for class and ID selectors? </h3>
    <p> CLASS: We can attach multiple class selectors to an element.
        .class{ // declarations of CSS }
        ID: We can attach only one ID selector to an element.
        #id{ // declarations of CSS }
    </p>
    <h3> 3. How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors? </h3>
    <p> When you group CSS selectors, you apply the same styles to several different elements without repeating the
        styles in your stylesheet.
        Instead of having two, three, or more CSS rules that do the same thing, you use a single CSS rule that
        accomplishes the same thing
    </p>
    <h3> 4. Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a
        single rule? </h3>
    <p> </p>
    <h3> 5. What does the descendant combinator do? </h3>
    <p> The descendant combinator, typically represented by a single space (" ") character and
        combines two selectors such that elements matched by the second selector are selected
        if they have an ancestor element matching the first selector.
    </p>
    <h3> 6. Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has the
        higher specificity? </h3>
    <p> If there are two or more declarations providing different property values for the same element, the declaration
        value in the style block having the matching selector with the greatest algorithmic weight gets applied.
        The value represents the count of selector components in each weight category and is written as ID - CLASS -
        TYPE.
        The three columns are created by counting the number of selector components for each selector weight category in
        the selectors that match the element.
    </p>
    <h3> 7. From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model properties? </h3>
    <p> The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders,
        padding, and the actual content. </p>
    <h3> 8. What does the box-sizing CSS property do? </h3>
    <p> The box-sizing CSS property sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated. </p>
    <h3> 9. What is the difference between the standard and alternative box model? </h3>
    <p> If you are using the standard box model, the size of the border is added to the width and height of the content
        box.
        If you are using the alternative box model then the size of the border makes the content box smaller as it takes
        up some of that available width and height of the element box.
    </p>
    <h3> 10. Would you use margin or padding to create more space between 2 elements? </h3>
    <p> we use margins when you're adjusting the spacing of an element in relation to another element. </p>
    <h3> 11. Would you use margin or padding to create more space between the contents of an element and its border?
    </h3>
    <p> we use padding when setting the space between an element's content and its border. </p>
    <h3> 12. Would you use margin or padding if you wanted two elements to overlap each other? </h3>
    <p> we can use margin, if you want elements to overlap. </p>
    <h3> 13. What is the difference between a block element and an inline element? </h3>
    <p> Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as
        bounded by the tags in the HTML element.
        Block elements have top and bottom margins. Inline elements don't have a top and bottom margin
    </p>
    <h3> 14. What is the difference between an inline element and an inline-block element? </h3>
    <p> Inline element, doesn't start on a new line and only occupy just the width it requires. You can't set the width
        or height. Inline-block, formatted just like the inline element, where it doesn't start on a new line.
        But, you can set width and height values.
    </p>
    <h3> 15. Is an h1 block or inline? </h3>
    <p> It is block element. </p>
    <h3> 16. Is button block or inline? </h3>
    <p> Button is a block element. </p>
    <h3> 17. Is div block or inline? </h3>
    <p> Div is a block element.</p>
    <h3> 18. Is span block or inline? </h3>
    <p> Span is an inline element. </p>
    <h3> 19. What is the difference between a flex container and a flex item? </h3>
    <p> Flex Container is the parent element while Flex Item represents the children. </p>
    <h3> 20. How do you create a flex item? </h3>
    <p> To create a flex container, we set the value of the area's container's display property to flex or inline-flex .
        As soon as we do this the direct children of that container become flex items.
    </p>
    <h3> 21. What are the 3 values defined in the shorthand flex property? </h3>
    <p> Three-value syntax: the values must be in the following order: a valid value for flex-grow . a valid value for
        flex-shrink . a valid value for flex-basis. </p>
    <h3> 22. How do you make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead of horizontally? </h3>
    <p> Use justify-content for the alignment of items horizontally. Use align-items for the alignment items vertically.
    </p>
    <h3> 23. What is the difference between justify-content and align-items? </h3>
    <p> justify-content, controls alignment of all items on the main axis.
        align-items, controls alignment of all items on the cross axis.
    </p>
    <h3> 24. How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex container? </h3>
    <p> We use 1. display: flex; 2. align-items : center; and the last step justify-content: center; </p>
    <h3> 25. What is the difference between justify-content: space-between and justify-content: space-around? </h3>
    <p> space-around, places items with space distributed evenly around the start and end of the list.
        space-between, evenly distributes space items between the first item is set at the start of the container, and
        the last item is set at the end.
    </p>
